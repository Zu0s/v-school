Was planning to put an edit/delete button but two things

    1. the example sight doesnt even show a edit and or delete button anywhere on it so guess not needed

    2 when trying to put a edit function the function was UNABLE to edit the state therefore not allowing me to change the original values of my input boxes so I can actually start step one of editing

useEffect problem

    can't think of any way of making useeffect actually render on submit cause if a get request is after my push request then it doesnt work cause it wont reload the page even thought I am changing my state in the submit function

these problems especially if you re add the edit part or basicaly uncommnet and add the few points where edit needs to be. edit WILL run and I can console log from the function but any way of changing the state from it is litteraly impossible and I cant change any part like I cant make it a string or just change the default blank strings to the information I have from the compoenent

also I am sending the correct information into the button that is activating the edit function but its just I have never seen a function on the same file as the state and cant change the state.

Didnt add css cause this context stuff not allowing me to do so much stuff like changing the state when THE FUNCTION IS IN THE SAME FILE AS THE STATE I AM TRYING TO CHANGE
