Was planning to put an edit/delete button but two things

    1. the example sight doesnt even show a edit and or delete button anywhere on it so guess not needed

    2 when trying to put a edit function the function was UNABLE to edit the state therefore not allowing me to change the original values of my input boxes so I can actually start step one of editing

useEffect problem

    can't think of any way of making useeffect actually render on submit cause if a get request is after my push request then it doesnt work cause it wont reload the page even thought I am changing my state in
